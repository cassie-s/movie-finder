# Movie Finder!

## Description:
Movie Finder Group Project

We were tasked with collaborating with team members in our group to come up with a project idea. We came up with an application that will solve the problem of finding a new movie to watch, and where to watch it. Our application will allow the user to generate a list of random movies to watch by genre. It will then display movie cards with a rating, brief description, and where to watch the movie. The user can also refresh suggestions and bookmark movies they wish to watch in the future. 
Using the agile methodology, we built an application from scratch to meet the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Features:
1. When the user visits our site, there is dropdown menu where they can search our from our movie database API by genre.
2. The page will then render two rows of movies in a card format, with rating and a brief description. 
3. If the user does not like the movies that are displayed, they can click on the "Refresh Suggestions" button to render a new set of movies on the page. 
4. When the user hovers over a movie, it will display a pop up with information about where to watch the movie they may be interested in. 
5. The user can also bookmark movies that they may be interested in watching by clicking on the bookmark icon in the movie card. 
6. Using local storage, our application will save those movies and get those movies when the user clicks on the "View Bookmarked Movies" button.
